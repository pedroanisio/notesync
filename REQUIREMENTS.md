# Project Requirements

This document specifies all mandatory requirements for the note-taking application. Each requirement has a unique ID for traceability and verification purposes.

## Functional Requirements

### Note Management
- **REQ-FUNC-001**: The system must allow users to create new notes with a title and content.
- **REQ-FUNC-002**: The system must allow users to edit existing notes.
- **REQ-FUNC-003**: The system must allow users to delete notes.
- **REQ-FUNC-004**: The system must display a list of all notes.
- **REQ-FUNC-005**: The system must support searching for notes by content.

### Note Linking
- **REQ-FUNC-010**: The system must automatically detect and create links between notes using the `[[note-id]]` syntax.
- **REQ-FUNC-011**: The system must maintain bidirectional links between notes.
- **REQ-FUNC-012**: The system must display backlinks for each note (notes that link to the current note).
- **REQ-FUNC-013**: The system must update links when notes are renamed or deleted.

### Tagging
- **REQ-FUNC-020**: The system must allow users to add tags to notes.
- **REQ-FUNC-021**: The system must support searching and filtering notes by tags.
- **REQ-FUNC-022**: The system must display all available tags in the interface.

### Search
- **REQ-FUNC-030**: The system must support full-text search across all notes.
- **REQ-FUNC-031**: The system must support semantic search using vector embeddings.
- **REQ-FUNC-032**: The system must display search results ranked by relevance.

## Technical Requirements

### Data Storage
- **REQ-TECH-001**: The system must use a relational database for storing note data.
- **REQ-TECH-002**: The system must implement appropriate database indexes for efficient querying.

### Note Identification
- **REQ-TECH-010**: Each note must be identified by a hash derived from its content.
- **REQ-TECH-011**: The system must implement collision detection by comparing the entire content when hash matches are found.
- **REQ-TECH-012**: The system must resolve hash collisions using one of the following strategies:
  a) Add a random salt and rehash
  b) Fallback to a UUID
  c) Add an incremental suffix to the hash

### Content Processing
- **REQ-TECH-020**: The system must support Markdown formatting in note content.
- **REQ-TECH-021**: The system must render Markdown content as HTML for display.
- **REQ-TECH-022**: The system must generate vector embeddings for semantic search functionality.

### API
- **REQ-TECH-030**: The system must provide a RESTful API for all note operations.
- **REQ-TECH-031**: API endpoints must follow standard REST conventions.
- **REQ-TECH-032**: The API must return appropriate HTTP status codes for success and error states.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **REQ-NFUNC-001**: The system must respond to user interactions within 500ms.
- **REQ-NFUNC-002**: The system must support concurrent access by multiple users.

### Security
- **REQ-NFUNC-010**: The system must implement appropriate authentication mechanisms.
- **REQ-NFUNC-011**: The system must secure API endpoints against unauthorized access.
- **REQ-NFUNC-012**: The system must sanitize user input to prevent injection attacks.

### Usability
- **REQ-NFUNC-020**: The system must provide a responsive user interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **REQ-NFUNC-021**: The system must provide clear feedback for user actions.
- **REQ-NFUNC-022**: The system must include appropriate error messages when operations fail.
